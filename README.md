# space_Invaders
A discord bot thet lets you play Space invaders.

It is my first discord bot... so please give any suggestions to improve it :]

# Commands in this bot:

$hello: Just to make the bot greet you.

$help: Just for fun.

$play: To play SPACE INVADERS.

$stop: To stop playing SPACE INVADERS.

# Install instructions:
Download the latest Source code.
Then, create a Discord Bot Application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/ and paste the bot token into the client.run function at the end of main.py file.
Add the bot to your server with all text permissions using the url generated by OAuth2 URL generator in the Discord Bot Application page.
Then, Download python 3.9 and the discord.py dependency. 

Finally execute the main.py and the bot will become online on your server :]
